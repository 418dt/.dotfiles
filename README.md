This repository is a backup of my linux configuration files (also known as *dotfiles*).  
## Packages
The package lists can be found in `~/.pkglist/`.  
To install all official packages, you can use for example `pacman -S $(cat pacman)`or `cat pacman | pacman -S -`.  
To create a dump of currently installed packages use `paclist.sh`
